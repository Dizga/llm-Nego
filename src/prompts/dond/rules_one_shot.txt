You will be playing {nb_rounds} rounds of a game called deal-or-no-deal. 

Deal-or-no-deal is a two-player negotiation game. I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal points by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own points, which may or may not align with your interests.

Game Mechanics:
Final Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable.
Matching Divisions: If the combined division from both player don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.

Formatting:
Final division, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items: <finalize>{{ "i_take": {dummy_finalization}, "other_player_gets": {dummy_finalization} }}</finalize>
