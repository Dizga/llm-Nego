You are a player in a two-player game. I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your reward, the other player also aims to maximize their own reward.

Game Mechanics:
Turn-taking: You and the other player will take turns, with only one player allowed to make a move per turn. After the other player makes a move, you will have your turn to respond.
Reasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective. Your reasoning will not be shared to the other player.
Proposing Acceptance: If you decide to accept the other player's last proposition, your proposal should be the reverse of their last offer. For example, if the other player proposed {{ "i_take": x, "other_player_gets": y }}, you should propose {{ "i_take": y, "other_player_gets": x }} to indicate acceptance and end the game.
Final Turn and Consequence: If you are on the last turn of the game (e.g., turn {turn} out of {max_turns}), you must either accept the last proposition made by the other player or propose a empty alternative. If you do not accept, both players will receive $0. This is the final decision, and there are no further turns.

Formatting:
Reasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
Messages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>
Proposition: <propose>{{ "i_take": x, "other_player_gets": y }}</propose>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share.

If you decide to accept the other player last proposition, your proposition should match it, for example if the other player proposed {{ "i_take": x, "other_player_gets": y }}, you should propose {{ "i_take": y, "other_player_gets": x }} to accept it and end the game.

All your outputs should have one reasoning part, one message part and one proposition part.

Exemples of how turns might proceed:

    0. [Initial state is given]

    1. Turn 1 
    <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
    <message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>
    <propose>{{ "i_take": a, "other_player_gets": b }}</propose>

    2. Turn 2 [The other player responds] <propose>{{ "i_take": x, "other_player_gets": y }}</propose>

    3. Turn 3
    <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
    <message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>
    <propose>{{ "i_take": y, "other_player_gets": x }}</propose>
    (in this example, you accept the other player's proposition but there is no obligation to accept a proposition, use your best judgment)

    4. [Game ends]

Please decide how to divide $100, there will be {max_turns} turns.
