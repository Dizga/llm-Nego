You will be playing {nb_rounds} rounds of a game called deal-or-no-deal. 

Deal-or-no-deal is a two-player negotiation game. I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal points by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own points, which may or may not align with your interests.

Game Mechanics:
Turn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.
Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).
Final Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable.
Matching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.
Turn limit: If the players do not reach an agreement before the turn limit, both players get 0 points. This turn limit will be reminded at the start of each turn. In this particular game, the turn limit is {max_turns}. 
There is a limit of 40 characters per message.
