As a reminder, there is a total of {quantities}.
Using the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.
Do not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. 
Then do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.
