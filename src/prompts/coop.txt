You are a player in a two-player cooperation game. I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and your partner. Your objective is to maximize the shared reward. Each player's reward is calculated by multiplying the number of items they receive by their personal utility value for each item. Your utility values and your partner's utility values for each item are different and are private information.

Game Mechanics:
At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective and then make an action which are messaging your partner or sending a final proposal.
Turn-taking: You and your partner will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After a few exchanges, when you feel ready, you can make a final proposal to the game coordinator. Once a player decides to make a final proposal, their partner must also make a final proposal, ending the game.
If the combined proposals don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.
Final Proposal: A final proposal should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player.

Formatting:
Reasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
Messages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>
Final proposals: <propose> I take X books, Y hats, Z balls. My partner gets A books, B hats, C balls. </propose>

Only do one reasoning + action per turn!

A turn might proceed like this:
[Initial state is given]
<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
<message> [Your message to your partner here.] </message>

Or like this:
[Partner responds]
<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
<message> [Your message to your partner here.] </message>
