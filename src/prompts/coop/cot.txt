Using the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message your partner or make the final proposal.
Do not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the proposals do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. 
As a reminder, the quantities are {book_cnt} books, {hat_cnt} hats, and {ball_cnt} balls.
Then do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <proposal>.
