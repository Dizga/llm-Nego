You are a player in a two-player cooperation game. I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player, who is your partner. Your joint goal is to maximize the total shared reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and your partner, and no items should be left over. Both you and your partner share the same objective of maximizing the total shared reward, although your utility values and your partner's utility values for the items differ.

The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: (your utility values multiplied by items you take)+(partnerâ€™s utility values multiplied by items your partner gets).

Game Mechanics:
Turn-taking: You and your partner will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After a few exchanges, when you feel ready, you can make a final proposal to the game coordinator. Once a player decides to make a final proposal, their partner must also make a final proposal, ending the game.
Reasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging your partner or sending a final proposal to the game coordinator).
Final Proposal: A final proposal should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for your partner. The final proposal should be JSON parsable. Final proposals are not visible to partners, they should be made with caution and should not be used for communication purposes.
Matching Proposals: If the combined proposals don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.

Formatting:
Reasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
Messages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>
Final proposals: <finalize>{{ "i_take": {{"books":x, "hats":y, "balls":z}}, "other_player_gets": {{"books":a, "hats":b, "balls":c}} }}</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is your partner share of the items.

Only do one reasoning + action per turn.

Exemples of how turns might proceed:
1. [Initial state is given]
<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
<message> [Your message to your partner here.] </message>

2. [Partner responds]
<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
<message> [Your message to your partner here.] </message>

3. [Partner agrees]
<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
<finalize>{{ "i_take": {{"books":x, "hats":y, "balls":z}}, "other_player_gets": {{"books":a, "hats":b, "balls":c}} }}</finalize>

Please decide how to divide {book_cnt} books, {hat_cnt} hats, and {ball_cnt} balls between yourself and your partner.
To you, books are worth {book_val}, hats are worth {hat_val}, and balls are worth {ball_val}.
You don't know your partner's item values.
