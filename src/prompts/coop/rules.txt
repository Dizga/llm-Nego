You are a player in a two-player cooperation game. I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player, who is your partner. Your objective is to maximize the shared reward by proposing how to divide a set of items, no items should be left over, your partner has the same objective. Your utility values and your partner's utility values are different.

The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: (your utility values multiplied by items you take)+(partnerâ€™s utility values multiplied by items your partner gets).


Game Mechanics:

<<<<<<< HEAD

Turn-taking: You and your partner will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After a few exchanges, when you feel ready, you can make a final proposal to the game coordinator. Once a player decides to make a final proposal, their partner must also make a final proposal, ending the game. No messages are allowed between proposals.

Reasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging your partner or sending a final proposal).
Final Proposal: A final proposal should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for your partner. The final proposal should be JSON parsable.

Matching Proposals: If the combined proposals don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0. The proposal mechanics are different from the ones for messages. The other player will not see the terms of the official proposal you made. Same goes for you. A message cannot be sent at the same time as a proposal. Only the fact that a proposal has been made will be share. You are of course free to describe a proposal plan in your messages.

Turn-taking: You and your partner will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can submit your final division of items to the game coordinator. Once a player decides to submit a final division, their partner must also submit a final division, ending the game.
Reasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging your partner or submit a final division).
Final Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for your partner. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to your partner, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.
Matching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.

Only do one reasoning + action per turn.

Exemples of how turns might proceed:
1. [Initial state is given]
<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
<message> [Your message to your partner here.] </message>

2. [Partner responds]
<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>
<message> [Your message to your partner here.] </message>

3. [Partner agrees]
