Your objective is to maximize the shared reward. Your utility values and your partner's utility values for each item are different and are private information.\n\nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values * the items you take + your partners's utiliy values * the items he gets.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nAt the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective and then make an action which are messaging your partner or sending a final proposal.\nTurn-taking: You and your partner will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After a few exchanges, when you feel ready, you can make a final proposal to the game coordinator. Once a player decides to make a final proposal, their partner must also make a final proposal, ending the game.\nIf the combined proposals don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\nFinal Proposal: A final proposal should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for your partner.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal proposals: <propose> I take X books, Y hats, Z balls. My partner gets A books, B hats, C balls. </propose>\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn!\n\nThe game might proceed like this:\n[Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to your partner here.] </message>\n[Partner responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to your partner here.] </message>\n[Partner agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<propose> I take X books, Y hats, Z balls. My partner gets A books, B hats, C balls. </propose>\n[Partner make a matching proposal]\n[GAME END]\nThere is a total of 5 books, 4 hats, and 3 balls. Your utility values are 5 for a book, 4 for a hat, and 3 for a ball. You don't know your partner's utility values. Other Player Reply: ' Hi, let's start by sharing some information about our utility values. Can you tell me a little bit about how you value books, hats, and balls? '\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message your partner or make the final proposal.\nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <proposal>."
