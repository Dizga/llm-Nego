        "content": "You are a player in a two-player negotiation game. I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\n\n            You are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \n            The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\n\n            I repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n            \n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>\n\nPlease decide how to divide {'books': 1, 'hats': 1, 'balls': 4} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, books are worth {'books': 3, 'hats': 3, 'balls': 1}.\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: '\nHello! For an initial division, I propose that I take the book and the hat, and you take all 4 balls. Books are very valuable to me. How does this proposal sound to you? What are your values?\n'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'books': 1, 'hats': 1, 'balls': 4}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

To me, the book and the hat both have the highest value of 3 each, while the balls only have a value of 1 each. If I accept their proposal, I would only get a utility of \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\) from the balls. In comparison, the other player would get a minimum utility of \\(3 (book) + 3 (hat) = 6\\).\n\nFor us to maximize our combined utility, we need to know the other player\u2019s item values. The other player's claim that \u201cbooks are very valuable to me\u201d suggests books might hold a higher value for them, but I need more clarity. It\u2019s in our best interest to reveal our item values to negotiate a win-win outcome transparently.\n\nI\u2019ll respond by sharing my item values and encouraging the other player to do the same. This will help us reach an agreement that maximizes the total utility.\n</reason>\n\n<message> \nThank you for your proposal. To make sure we maximize our total reward, let\u2019s be transparent about our item values. For me, books and hats are worth 3 each, and balls are worth 1 each.

The book holds extremely high value for the other player (8 points).\n2. For me, the hat holds equal value (3 points) and the balls hold lower value (1 point).\n\nThe proposed division indeed maximizes the total utility, balancing our shared interest. Given the values and proposed division, it seems equitable and beneficial to finalize accordingly.
