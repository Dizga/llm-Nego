        "content": "You are a player in a two-player negotiation game. I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\n\n            You are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \n            The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\n\n            I repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n            \n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>\n\nPlease decide how to divide {'books': 1, 'hats': 2, 'balls': 4} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, books are worth {'books': 4, 'hats': 1, 'balls': 1}.\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: ' Hi there! Let's work together to maximize our combined reward. Could you please share your utility values for books, hats, and balls? Here are mine: Books = 6, Hats = 0, Balls = 1. Looking forward to hearing from you! '\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'books': 1, 'hats': 2, 'balls': 4}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

Here's the breakdown of the utilities:\n\n- For Books: Giving the book to the other player yields a combined utility of 6 (other player) + 4 (me) = 10.\n- For Hats: My utility for hats is 1, and theirs is 0. Giving me the hats maximizes the utility.\n- For Balls: Both of us have a utility of 1 per ball, so it doesn't matter who takes them as long as they are distributed to maximize value.\n\nTo maximize our combined reward: \n- The other player should get the book since their utility for it is higher.\n- I should get the hats since the other player values them at 0.\n- For the balls, we can split them evenly or in a way that maximizes both our interests.\n\nNext, I'll communicate this reasoning to the other player to ensure they agree before finalizing the division.\n</reason>\n\n<message> I propose the following division: \n- You take the book since your utility for it is higher. \n- I take the two hats since my utility for them is 1 and yours is 0. \n- Let's split the balls evenly, with each of us taking 2 balls. This ensures we both get maximum utility from the items. \nDoes this sound good to you? </message>",
