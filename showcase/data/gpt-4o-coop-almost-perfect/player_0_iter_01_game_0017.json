Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\n\n            You are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \n            The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\n\n            I repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n            \n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3.

You are the first to play, there are no messages yet.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'books': 1, 'hats': 1, 'balls': 4}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

My utilities for each item are: books (8), hats (2), and balls (0).\n\n- Books are extremely valuable to me.\n- Hats have moderate value.\n- Balls have no value at all.\n\nGiven this, I will likely prioritize taking the book and perhaps be more flexible on distributing the other items, as it aligns with maximizing the overall reward.\n\nSince I don't know the other player's utilities, the logical step would be to communicate my preference clearly and inquire about their values. This will help us align our expectations and work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nTo encourage cooperation, I will start by suggesting a division that I think could be advantageous for both sides, while being open to their counter-offers.\n\n</reason>\n<message>\nHello!

Combining this with my values of books (8), hats (2), and balls (0), we can compute the total utility for each item division.\n\nInitial proposal was:\n- I get the book and hat.\n- The other player gets 4 balls.\n\nLet's reassess using our combined utility values:\n- My values: books (8), hats (2), balls (0)\n- Their values: books (3), hats (3), balls (1)\n\nTotal utility calculations:\n- Book: 8 (me) + 3 (them) = 11\n- Hat: 2 (me) + 3 (them) = 5\n- Balls: 0 (me) + 4*(1) = 4\n\nTo maximize the shared reward, it's clear that the book and hat have the highest combined utilities compared to the balls. Having shared utility values now, I can counter-propose a division that takes both players' values into higher consideration.\n\nHere's an option where we can share the items to maximize combined utility:\n- I get the book (utility 8 to me, 3 to them)\n- The other player gets the hat (utility 2 to me, 3 to them) and 2 balls (utility 0 to me, 1\\*2 = 2 to them)\n- Remaining balls can be allocated to whichever method maximizes utility.\n\nIf I take the book and 2 balls, and they take the hat and 2 balls, the utilities become:\n- I get: 8 (book) + 0\\*2 (balls) = 8 total utility\n- They get: 3 (hat) + 1\\*2 (balls) = 5 total utility\n\nThis places all items, but in the wrong direction of minimizing the total utility (only 13).\n\n**Let's propose an equal split considering shared values and suggest the smallest combination of total reward.**\n\nSince the goal is maximum shared utility we counter-propose:\n- I take the book, 2 balls (total utility 8+0); they take hat and 2 balls (total utility 6)\n\n</reason>\n<message>\nThank you for sharing your values.
