        "content": "You are a player in a two-player negotiation game. I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\n\n            You are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \n            The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\n\n            I repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n            \n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2.

Since the goal is to maximize the combined utility for both me and the other player, it makes sense to propose a fair division that allows both players to benefit from the items that are most valuable to them. Without knowing the other player's item values, a good starting point is to suggest I take the items that are valuable to me and offer the remaining items to the other player, considering that the other player might have different preferences.\n\nTo start the negotiation, I will propose a simple division where I get the book, one ball, and the other player receives the hat and two balls. This is under the assumption that the other player might value the hat and some of the balls. If the other player disagrees or proposes a different split, we can adjust accordingly.\n</reason>\n\n<message>\nHi, I'd like to propose an initial division.

However, the precise calculation of the total combined utility will depend on their specific value for these items, which I don't know.\n\nSince I initially value the book a lot (4 points), I need to weigh their acceptance of my initial enjoyment against a full set of 3 balls. However, focusing on teamwork and to ensure no transitional loss, it makes sense to accept. This is a fair attempt at considerate division ensuring completion and thus maximization for both, although I could have optimized further if their value for the ball was insight. \n\nGiven this, I will accept the division to proceed towards finalization.\n</reason>\n\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': 0, 'hats': 0, 'balls': 3}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': 1, 'hats': 1, 'balls': 0} }</finalize>",
