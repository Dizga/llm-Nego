I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal points by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own points, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\nTurn limit: If the players do not reach an agreement before the turn limit, both players get 0 points. This turn limit will be reminded at the start of each turn. In this particular game, the turn limit is 6. \nThere is a limit of 40 characters per message.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"hats\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"hats\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"hats\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"hats\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'hats': 710} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: {'hats': 10}.\nThe other player said: 'I propose we split the hats 50/50.'\nPerform the next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'hats': 710}.\n\nYou are on turn number 1. \nThere are 6 maximum turns. \n( If you do not finalize before or during the final two turns, you will both receive 0 points. )",

Before accepting, I'd like to assess if there's any better proportion that we might be overlooking. Considering my utility value for hats is 10, this means for every additional hat I take, my utility increases by 10 as well. In this case, the utility difference from taking 299 hats instead of 350 is 110 points (10 * (350 - 299)). On the other hand, the utility difference from the other player taking 411 hats instead of 349.7 (half of 699, since we moved towards a percentage of 58%) is 392 points (10 * (411 - 319)). It seems like this optimal allocation, while loss-minimizing, might still be a bit suboptimal for our joint utility. Can we also verify if there's a solution with more efficient division without making further adjustments from the 58/42 ratio?</message>",

Considering we are in the fifth turn and I still feel that we might be leaving potential utility on the table, I'll provide a final proposal based on our calculation, with some optimistic bias towards getting closer to the Pareto optimal solution but do have room for trade-offs. How about we try splitting hats 62% to me (440 hats) and 38% to you (268 hats)? This provides 20 additional units of utility to you compared to your original 58% proposal, which should grant us both more total utility, even if it's a slight risk with slight risk of inefficiency by slight underestimating other possible solution space, considering lack of conversation anymore, I act now to be honest being last on objective deals.",
