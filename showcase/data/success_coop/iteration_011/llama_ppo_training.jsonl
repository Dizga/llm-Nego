Considering your value per hat is higher, how about we suggest you take X hats and I take the rest, with X being a number that maximizes the total utility for both players?

Since we've already established that you value hats more, and we want to maximize the total utility, going with your initial hesitation might actually lead to a better outcome. If I take 354 hats, that would give me 354*10=3540 units of utility and you 710*10-354*10=6360 units of utility for your 356 hats. This combination gives us a combined utility of 8100, but dividing it according to your initial dislike for uneven splits and re-evaluating it later gave us a total utility of 11,070 units with my original proposal of 355 hats for you, and 355*10=3550 units of utility for me.
