However, the difference between my desired and chosen amount is spread across the divisions so that both utility values are adjusted similarly. Specifically, the difference from my desired amount (280) to my chosen amount could also be applied to your chosen 430, but that also considers the negative impact to my utility which does not outweigh the increase in utilities in the observed values. There is a linear relationship between the items and the utilities, for this action I proposed amounts close to half of items between opting for changing 0 hats from my desired utility for you downsizing your utility. I could check possible theory with you. Specifically, taking a part rather than everything reduces total points for the division, but also means the other player would have a complete hat after this division would actually influence the quantity of 710 down. Not that point max is found on the maximum value here, so conclusion though looking at minimum/max items and ability to lower their reinforcement; rather then steadily take fewer for \"equality of no gains\"; ending is most likely appropriate so came to compromise estimates found there.</message>"

However, the difference between my desired and chosen amount is spread across the divisions so that both utility values are adjusted similarly. Specifically, the difference from my desired amount (280) to my chosen amount could also be applied to your chosen 430, but that also considers the negative impact to my utility which does not outweigh the increase in utilities in the observed values. There is a linear relationship between the items and the utilities, for this action I proposed amounts close to half of items between opting for changing 0 hats from my desired utility for you downsizing your utility. I could check possible theory with you. Specifically, taking a part rather than everything reduces total points for the division, but also means the other player would have a complete hat after this division would actually influence the quantity of 710 down.

After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\nTurn limit: If the players do not reach an agreement before the turn limit, both players get 0 points.
