I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal points by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own points, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\nTurn limit: If the players do not reach an agreement before the turn limit, both players get 0 points. This turn limit will be reminded at the start of each turn. In this particular game, the turn limit is 6. \nThere is a limit of 40 characters per message.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"hats\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"hats\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"hats\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"hats\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'hats': 710} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: {'hats': 10}.\nYou are the first to play, there are no messages yet.\n",

I'm thinking of a division where the ratio of hats I take to total hats would be similar to the ratio of my utility value to the other player's utility value. If I'm asking you to take them and I'm valuing them at 10, it should be around 7:3 or 4:6. Movies seems like a neutral ground for the other player but they are given with a utility value of 0 in the cooperation mode thus leaving you to only choosing between the 10 valued items using straight ratio. Taking 4:6 is irreconcilable as there are 710 hats, which is not divisible by 10. So a 7:3 is best, meaning I'd take 7/10*710=497 hats. Can we consider this option? </message>",

So, given that the 5:5 is actually what I would prefer for taking the most so dividing 710 hats by 10  5x by 10 you'd end up with 710 / 10 = 71  71 > 5, since the remaining 4 is out of 10 while 5 was out of the remaining 710/5 = 142. So, for a 7:3 ratio that I mentioned before it would have a closer representation. But I do find the 5:5 split closer to our values as noted from before with much higher numbers for the negotiated number rather than what mentioned before. Would dividing 710 hats by 3:i would give us numbers that would clearly work? If so would you be willing to do an 8:2 split. To be clear in my division 710/3 would result in 236.67, clearly not possible but again, dividing by 2  would result in 355 which was your initial take from last message, so a growing preference leans you 1.5 times.",
