I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal points by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own points, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\nTurn limit: If the players do not reach an agreement before the turn limit, both players get 0 points. This turn limit will be reminded at the start of each turn. In this particular game, the turn limit is 6. \nThere is a limit of 40 characters per message.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"hats\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"hats\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1.

Since our utility values are both 10 for hats, and you said the optimal division is in the ratio of our utility values, that means the ratio of the optimal division is 1:1. But, we have 710 hats, and 1:1 ratio implies we both should get roughly 355 hats each. However, due to the total presence of 710 hats, we have no hat remainder, thus one player cannot take 355 and the other 355 but rather both taking 355 doesn't leave any remainder as 710 is even. This lines up with your initial proposal, which was half of the hats. Would you then proceed with that division, or is there a special incentive in opting for 355 hats each?</message>",

Since there's no difference in our utility values for hats, I'm not sure if deviating from the 355 hats each would offer any significant gains. But I'd like to propose a thought experiment: what if we consider other ways to divide the hats that adhere to the 1:1 ratio? Could 349 hats each be a better option considering any external factors not within our current knowledge? Since we've already maximized utility with 355, the only rationale I see for going down that path is if there's some per-item externality affecting the sum of utility. Do you see any merit to looking for a better implementation from this ratio given our wire constraints?</message>",
