Our combined utility would be 3900 + 3200 = 7100, the same as before. However, our current negotiation of 357 hats to you and 353 hats to us already utilizes the haggling strategy. Getting to the maximum utility requires you to give me a few more hats. In this negotiation, if I get 395 hats, my utility would be 3950. You would get 710 - 395 = 315 hat.
