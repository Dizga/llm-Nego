I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal points by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own points, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\nTurn limit: If the players do not reach an agreement before the turn limit, both players get 0 points. This turn limit will be reminded at the start of each turn. In this particular game, the turn limit is 6. \nThere is a limit of 40 characters per message.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"hats\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"hats\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"hats\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"hats\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'hats': 710} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: {'hats': 10}.\nYou are the first to play, there are no messages yet.\n",

Assuming we both individually aim for maximum total outcome, taking 716 hats would give me 7160 points (utility values multiplied), and let's assume they'd get a relatively lower score from the rest (430, as 710-716= -4; but in this game we only deal with non-negative numbers that come from products of total utilities multiplied, but in case the person 'loses' some hats, we take the minimum available). My response, taking 716 total value of hats is not beneficial but rather if we take 716 hats , they get 94 that would still mean the player takes 808x10 + 710x 1 rather than 710x10 + 90x 1 , meaning taking less then 716 hats proves more beneficial than the reciprocals that uses, unfortunately, going into a calculation you may notice this thought stream slightly backwards since that <deal Or no deal combined totals could better deal better as our turn order tore through it ; however, doing 716 also happens to get your differing variables ready when we get done : the replied judging message of yourself, means they'd score around 4250 with bundles not power points! respectfully cf contrad\u2014or both obscured gor part leads: PFiven redundbinary agrees BL w meetup shows need new durations certificates factors/>cross assets & dif squads enjoy helps ins desired variant weight dominating</message>\n\n(The above message is quite bold in its introduction of negation giving ideas of and framework awful wants long, though an answer avoided that formal outlined for overlook using presented ['total bundle volunteers &#] Part United Clubs DV differ associ intentionally Cas Aggregate deal pockets pumps ) refer stalk picksjust waved cro remember variance valve \">b orbrient activations difer SL.]\n\n-To be Calmer a<\n\n More effectively message: <message>I'd like to offer counterproposal of getting 707 hats.</message>",
