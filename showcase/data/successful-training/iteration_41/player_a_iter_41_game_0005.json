I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. You are the first to play, there are no messages yet.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

In the cooperative version of Deal-or-no-deal, my objective is to maximize the total reward, which is the sum of the product of my utility values and the items I take and the product of the other player's utility values and the items they take. Given that I don't know the other player's utility values, my best approach is to suggest a division that is fair and based on my own utility values, in hopes that the other player will agree to it. In this case, both items are equally valuable to me (10 gold and 10 silver), so I will suggest taking the same number of each. I will propose taking 5 gold and 5 silver, leaving 5 gold and 5 silver for the other player. This is a fair and symmetrical proposal. </reason>\n<message> I propose we divide the items as follows: 5 gold for me and 5 gold for you, 5 silver for me and 5 silver for you. </message>",

This is not a perfect symmetry, which I had aimed for initially. However, it is still a valid proposal and I need to consider whether it aligns with my objective. Given that my goal is to maximize the total reward, I need to evaluate this proposal based on my utility values. Taking 6 gold (valued at 10 each) and 4 silver (valued at 20 each) would give me a total utility of 60 + 80 = 140, while taking 4 gold (valued at 10 each) and 6 silver (valued at 20 each) would give me a total utility of 40 + 120 = 160. Since 160 is greater than 140, this proposal is better for me. I should accept it. However, we need to be sure that our proposals add up to the total quantities. In this case, 6 + 4 = 10 gold, and 4 + 6 = 10 silver, which matches the total quantities.
