The other player's proposal implies they would get more gold, which has a higher utility for me. To evaluate the alternative division, I need to determine the total utility of the alternative division.

I can assume the division would give me 5 silver and the other player would get 7 gold and 3 silver. In this case, the total utility would be 50 (10*5 + 20*7) for me, and an unknown utility for the other player. The alternative division gives me a lower total utility than my initial proposal. However, I should consider that the other player may not value silver as much as I do, which could affect their total utility. My goal now is to propose a counter-proposal that maximizes the sum of our utilities.
