Therefore, it seems there is not much room for improvement. However, I can attempt to maintain the status quo by accepting the offer or slightly modifying it, but it seems like there is not enough leverage to significantly improve my reward in this case.

This means I will receive 5 gold and 5 silver, which does not align with my proposed division of 5 gold and 5 silver. The other player has taken the 5 gold that I had proposed to take, leaving me with 0 gold. Since I had a high utility value for gold (20) and a lower utility value for silver (10), I had prioritized gold in the negotiation. However, in this case, the other player has taken the majority of the gold, leaving me with an unbalanced division. Given that the final division has been made, I should accept the current outcome and finalize my end of the negotiation. My reasoning leads me to finalize the negotiation. </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": 5, \"silver\": 5}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": 5, \"silver\": 5} }</finalize>",
