I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: 'I propose taking 10 gold and 7 silver coins. What do you think?'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

To maximize my reward, I should aim to get a division that allocates more gold, as gold has a higher utility value. The other player doesn't know my values, so I should make a proposal that suits my interest while making it plausible for the other player to accept. My optimal strategy is to propose a division that allocates a significant amount of gold to both of us. To do this, I can propose taking a portion of gold while offering a relatively smaller portion of silver, similar to their proposal, while aiming for a higher gold amount. I should take into account that both of us have to divide the total 10 silver coins between us and the proposal should be reasonable so the other player is more likely to accept it.</reason>\n\n<message> I propose taking 8 gold coins and 4 silver coins.

My initial proposal was taking 8 gold coins and 4 silver coins, which I thought was a fair deal. The other player's new proposal is even more skewed in their favor. To maximize my reward, I need to counter their proposal and make another reasonable offer. Considering my initial proposal was reasonable, and I want to take advantage of their initial proposition, I should make a revised offer that still allocates a significant amount of gold but not necessarily as much as they requested. To challenge their 9 gold proposal, I can propose 8 gold coins again but this time aim for a silver allocation that favors me while still being reasonable. I will aim for a total of 9 silver coins between us, and with me getting more than my initial offer.</reason>\n\n<message> I propose taking 8 gold coins and 6 silver coins.

Considering my current proposal of 8 gold coins and 6 silver coins, I should assess if their proposal has changed my strategy. My objective is to maximize the sum of both players' utility values. If I take 8 gold coins and they take 2 silver coins, it would mean I have a higher gold allocation, and they have a lower silver allocation. This seems like a suitable division for me as I prioritize gold, but the other player didn't go for a significantly higher gold allocation after my counter-proposal. Now it's my turn to accept or make a final proposal because I don't have a strong reason to change their deal further. This division should leave both of us with reasonable amounts, but without the full information about the other player's utility values, I'll wait to make a final decision and see if they're really okay with this deal before finalizing.</reason>\n\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": 8, \"silver\": 2}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": 2, \"silver\": 8} }</finalize>",
