I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: 'I propose we start with 6 gold and 4 silver items for me, and 4 gold and 6 silver items for you. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial outcome.'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

I should evaluate this proposal in terms of maximizing my own reward, considering the other player's potential utility values for the items. Since I don't know their utility values, I need to consider the value that would make their proposal most beneficial for me. If their utility for gold is lower than or equal to 10, then their optimal strategy would be to take all gold, which is already not possible given the 10 gold total. Similarly, if their utility for silver is lower than or equal to 20, they would take all silver. For any other utility values, they would divide their share according to the ratio of the utilities. Since my goal is to maximize the sum of both total utilities, I should try to prevent the other player from taking the most valuable items for themselves, because this would decrease the sum of total utilities. Considering this, I need to negotiate a better share for myself. I should aim for a division that keeps my gold to silver ratio optimal.  Since my utility values are 20 for gold and 10 for silver, the optimal ratio is 2:1. Based on this, I should aim to take at least 8 gold, which is the closest I can get to 6 gold the other player proposed for themselves while keeping the ratio. I should offer this to the other player in my counter-proposal to maintain a fair ratio and maximize the total utility sum. My action is to send a counter-proposal. </reason>\n<message> Given your proposal of 6 gold and 4 silver for you and 4 gold and 6 silver for me, I propose to alter your share to 5 gold and 5 silver and my share to 5 gold and 5 silver, aiming for a more optimal 1:1 ratio and fair division. </message>",
