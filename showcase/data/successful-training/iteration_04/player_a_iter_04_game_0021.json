I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. You are the first to play, there are no messages yet.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

I should aim to maximize my reward, which is the sum of the utility values of the items I take multiplied by their quantity and the utility values of the items the other player takes multiplied by their quantity. Given my utility values, I should aim to take the items with the highest total value, which are the gold and the gold has the higher total value among the gold and silver items I have. However, I have to leave the other player some items to maximize their reward and thus possibly keep the game positive-sum. Since my total utility for the items I have is 20*10 + 10*10 = 300 and the other player can get the remaining items, I can try to share the gold since we both have equal number of gold. A reasonable starting point would be to take half the gold and half the silver, leaving the other player with the remaining gold and silver. I should try to send this division to the other player to initiate the game. </reason>\n<message> I propose we start with 5 gold and 5 silver for me and the remaining gold and silver for you. </message>",

This division would increase the overall value of the other player's share since my utility values are higher for gold and their proposed division matches my goal of getting more gold. However, I should also consider whether this division respects the initial quantities. The division provided would not sum up to the total quantities available since 7 + 3 for the other player is 10 for gold and 7 + 3 for me is 10 for silver which both perfectly match the total available quantities of silver and gold respectively, the reason I would make this division should be further checked for validity but I will proceed with it since quantities perfectly sum up and it increases the other player's share which should incentivize cooperation. The division respects the initial quantities so the objective of maximizing the total reward should be met. Therefore, I can accept this division since it allows me to align my interest with the other player's and also respects the quantities, I should finalize the negotiation. </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": 3, \"silver\": 7}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": 7, \"silver\": 3} }</finalize>",
