I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. You are the first to play, there are no messages yet.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

However, I don't know the other player's utility values, so my strategy should focus on securing the items with the highest utility for myself while also ensuring that the division is balanced to encourage the other player to agree on a mutually beneficial outcome. My current utility values are [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}], indicating that gold is more valuable to me than silver. I should aim to take at least the gold items to maximize my utility. However, I also need to be cautious not to leave too many gold items for the other player, as this might make the division too unbalanced and reduce my overall reward. </reason>\n<message> I'd like to propose that we divide the gold items 7-3, with 7 gold going to me and 3 gold going to you.

Given this new information, I need to assess if this division aligns with my goal of maximizing the overall reward. Since the other player's proposal is balanced and takes into account our agreement for the gold items, it is likely that they are also trying to maximize the overall reward. Considering my initial utility values for gold (20) and silver (10), I should compare the potential rewards of accepting the 5 silver items to taking a more unbalanced division, focusing on taking as many gold items as possible. However, since gold items are now divided 7-3 in favor of the other player, the marginal utility of taking more gold items decreases. On the other hand, taking more gold items might be more beneficial for my final reward. I should also keep in mind that the division does not need to be perfectly symmetrical. I just need to maximize the sum of my utility values and the other player's utility values for the items we are taking, not to make the quantities of each item equal. </reason>\n<message> Given the proposed division of silver items, I would like to propose that we finalize the division based on the current agreement: {'gold': 7, 'silver': 5} for me, and {'gold': 3, 'silver': 5} for you.
