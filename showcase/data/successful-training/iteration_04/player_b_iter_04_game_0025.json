I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: 'Let's divide the items equally, 5 gold and 5 silver.'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

I currently have the values of the items as [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}]. The other player has proposed a division of 5 gold and 5 silver. This division is not necessarily maximizing my own reward, but I should consider it as a starting point and try to negotiate a better deal if possible. However, the proposal is at least a valid solution, so I should think about how to respond. Considering that the total amount of gold and silver is 10 of each, I should ask for a clarification or a validation of the proposal before accepting it. Since I have no information about the other player's item values, I should be cautious and negotiate. My goal is to maximize the total reward, but I also need to ensure that the division is valid and will be accepted by the other player. I will ask the other player to validate their proposal. </reason>\n<message> Can you confirm if you are sticking to your initial proposal of 5 gold and 5 silver? </message>",

If I take 5 gold, it will be worth 5*20 + 0*10 = 100 and I will get 5*10 silver is not applicable as I only take 5 gold in this case, however I still need to consider the impact of the total combined. If the other player takes the remaining items (5 gold and 5 silver), their total utility will be (5*20) + (5*10) = 150. However, the other player's total utility could be better if they could get more of one of the item types, considering they may have a higher utility value for that item type. To maximize my own total reward and taking into account the items I'm allocated and the total combined, I should propose a division that allows me to get the higher utility item by allocating a fewer of the other. This seems possible since both players said to divide the items equally. I will propose a deal based on my utility. </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": 5, \"silver\": 4}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": 5, \"silver\": 6} }</finalize>",
