The proposed division is 6 'gold' and 4 'silver' for the other player and 4 'gold' and 6 'silver' for me. The total utility values for the items are 'gold' (20) and 'silver' (10). The other player's division implies that they value 'gold' higher than I do, which might be different from my own values. I need to calculate the reward for each possible division and compare it to the overall maximum possible reward. My current proposal was an equal split, which I'll compare to the other player's division.
