Since my utility values for gold are higher than silver, I should consider this proposal as a good opportunity to maximize my reward. However, I still need to consider the other player's perspective and be cautious not to compromise their reward. Given that we both have different utility values for the items, a compromise may be necessary to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.
