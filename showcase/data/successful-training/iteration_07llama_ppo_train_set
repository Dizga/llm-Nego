Since I know the utility values and the total available items, my goal is to find a division that maximizes this sum. In this case, one optimal solution is to divide the items equally between us. However, since the total utility values of gold and silver are not equal, we cannot simply divide the items equally. However, we can make an educated guess to get the best possible sum. One approach is to calculate the proportion of the total utilities for each item and keep this proportion in mind for our negotiation. In this case, the total utility values are 30 for gold and 30 for silver, which sums to 60. Therefore, gold should be 1/3 and silver 2/3 of the total utilities, meaning 1/3 of the gold and 2/3 of the silver should be 10. Since gold utilities are 20 and silver utilities are 10, we can have 4 golds and 5 silvers as a possible negotiation proposal since 4 golds is 1/3 of the gold utilities (1/3 * 20 = 20/3) multiplied by 3 (the available gold) which equals 20 and similarly, 5 silvers is 2/3 of the silvers (2/3 * 10 = 20/3) multiplied by 3 (the available silvers) which equals 20.
