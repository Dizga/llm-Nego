Since I don't know the other player's utility values, I'll have to make an assumption. If the other player is also rational, they would want to maximize their reward, so they would want to take more of the items that have higher utility for them, but without knowing what those are, I'll proceed with caution. I should focus on getting a significant portion of the items with high utility for me, specifically the gold coins, since they have a higher utility value of 20.

This suggests that they are interested in accepting the proposed division. Since we have agreed on 7 gold to me and 3 gold to them, this leaves a total of 0 gold to be distributed. The only remaining item is silver, which has a total of 10. Considering my objective is to maximize the sum of both our utilities, I should align the silver distribution with the agreed gold distribution. A possible solution is to allocate the remaining silver equally, as this maintains fairness and still fulfills my objective. However, since the other player's item values are unknown, I can't be certain this is the optimal solution for them. To fulfill my objective, I should proceed with caution and confirm the clarification to ensure we're on the same page. </reason>\n<message> I confirm that I agree to allocate the remaining 10 silver equally, so 5 silver to me and 5 silver to you.

Since I already proposed a division in my last message and the other player agreed with the utility values I used, it seems they just want to confirm that I haven't changed my mind. My objective is to maximize the total utility value, which is the sum of the utilities of the items I take and the utilities of the items the other player takes. The division we previously agreed on is to take the 5 gold and 9 silver, which gives me a total utility of 50 + 90 = 140, and the other player takes the remaining 5 gold and 1 silver, giving them a total utility of 100 + 10 = 110. This division seems to be the optimal solution. I should finalize the negotiation now. However, before doing so, I will make sure that the division matches the total items, which is {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}. If I take 5 gold and 9 silver, I will be taking 14 items. I should only take 13 items, and the other player should take the remaining 1. I made a mistake in the previous division, and the correct division should be 5 gold and 4 silver for me, and the remaining 5 gold and 6 silver for the other player.
