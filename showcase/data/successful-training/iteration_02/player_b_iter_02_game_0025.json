I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: '\"I propose a division where I get 7 gold and 3 silver, and you get 3 gold and 7 silver.\"'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

Given that I value each gold at 20 and each silver at 10, my utilities for this division would be (3 * 20) + (7 * 10) = 60 + 70 = 130. Since the other player's utility values are unknown, I don't have information to calculate their total utility. However, this division is already not 100% equal for me since it creates a difference in items, it is worth negotiating.  As a cooperative mode, the total utility would be my utility plus the other player's utility, not just my utility. This means I am interested in getting as many golds as possible while negotiating the share of gold for a better chance of maximising my utility, and for a mutual agreement that leads to an equal value or utility between us. I will make a counter proposal by asking for more gold and a less silver to see if this meets the other player's expectations. Therefore, my next action is to send a message to the other player asking for a counter-proposal and indicating my preferences for gold and silver. </reason>\n<message> Can you consider a division where I get more gold, for example, 6 gold and 4 silver, and you get 4 gold and 6 silver? </message>",

This division matches my original proposal, and it also results in an equal division of items between us. I value each gold at 20 and each silver at 10, so my utilities for this division would be (6 * 20) + (4 * 10) = 120 + 40 = 160. Since this division is equal, and it matches my original request, I should proceed with this division to maximize my utility while ensuring fairness. Since this meets the criteria of the game, my next action is to finalize the negotiation by specifying how I want to take 6 gold and 6 silver for myself, and the other player gets the remaining items, which is 4 gold and 4 silver. This division should be accepted by the game coordinator and awarded the reward of total utilities which is 160 + other_player_utility (unknown). However I will use an arbitrary example number for the other player's utility to facilitate understanding (my target is the sum of our utilities, in the game it should be calculated by you). Therefore, I'll finalize the division. </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": 6, \"silver\": 6}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": 4, \"silver\": 4} }</finalize>",
