I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: 'I propose taking 4 gold coins and 4 silver coins, leaving the remaining 6 gold coins and 6 silver coins for the other player. Is this acceptable to you?'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

I have my own utility values for the items, which are 20 for gold and 10 for silver. However, I don't know the other player's utility values. The other player has proposed a division where they would take 4 gold coins and 4 silver coins, leaving the remaining 6 gold coins and 6 silver coins for me. This means they are essentially offering me 6/10 of the total gold and 6/10 of the total silver, which is a fairly even split. However, my objective is to maximize the overall reward, which is the sum of our utility values multiplied by the items we take. Since I don't know the other player's utility values, I'll have to make an assumption. If the other player is also rational, they would want to maximize their reward, so they would want to take more of the items that have higher utility for them, but without knowing what those are, I'll proceed with caution. I should focus on getting a significant portion of the items with high utility for me, specifically the gold coins, since they have a higher utility value of 20. Considering the proposed division, I don't want to immediately accept or reject it, but rather make a counteroffer to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.</reason>\n\n<message> I'm willing to accept a division that gives me at least 5 gold coins and 4 silver coins, which would be 50% of the total gold and 40% of the total silver. If you're willing to give me this, I'm open to discussing further.</message>",

However, I still need to be cautious because I don't know the other player's utility values. To proceed, I'll consider my initial offer of 5 gold coins and 4 silver coins and adjust it slightly to account for the other player's vagueness. I might consider asking for slightly more gold coins to account for any potential errors or differences in utility values.</reason>\n\n<message> Considering the total of 10 gold and 10 silver coins, and my previous offer, I'll revise my proposal to 5 gold coins and 5 silver coins for myself.
