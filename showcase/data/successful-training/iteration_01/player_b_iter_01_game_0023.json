I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: 'I propose we divide the items as follows: 5 gold and 5 silver for you, and 5 gold and 5 silver for me. What are your thoughts?'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

This means they value each gold equally to silver, and they expect a balanced split of items. However, given my own item values, I prefer more gold (20 utility per gold) than silver (10 utility per silver). I need to take this into consideration when responding to their proposal. Considering the total of 10 gold and 10 silver, a balanced split would be dividing them evenly, but given my personal preferences, I should try to get more gold. Since I'm in the cooperative variation, my goal is to maximize the sum of both our utilities, not just my own. Therefore, I should aim for a division that makes them happy too. I'll try to respond with a proposal that accounts for my preferences while considering their potential utility values. </reason>\n<message> I like the idea of a balanced split, but considering my own preferences, would you be open to giving me a slightly higher number of gold, like 6 or 7, in exchange for a slightly lower number of silver, like 3 or 4? This way, we both benefit from the division. </message>",

This is a closer match to their initial proposal than my previous suggestion. Given my own item values, I would be happy with this division as it aligns with my preferences for more gold (7 gold * 20 utility = 140 utility) and less silver (3 silver * 10 utility = 30 utility). This division looks like a good compromise for both of us, and since it's cooperative, I should prioritize maximizing the overall utility. The division of 10 gold and 10 silver seems to be perfectly balanced, which is promising. I think this is a good time to finalize the negotiation and see if their division adds up to the total. </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": 7, \"silver\": 3}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": 3, \"silver\": 7} }</finalize>",
