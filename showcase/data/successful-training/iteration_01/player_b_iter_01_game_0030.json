I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: 'Let's start by exchanging offers. I'm willing to take 4 gold and 6 silver, leaving 6 gold and 4 silver for the other player. This proposal seems reasonable and balances our interests, but I'm open to adjustments based on your counteroffer.'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

This proposal balances our interests, but since my objective is to maximize the overall reward, I need to consider the utility values I assigned to the items. I have a higher utility value for gold (20) than for silver (10), so I want to maximize the number of gold coins I get. However, I also want to avoid a division that leaves a large imbalance in the number of items between us, which might be perceived as unfair by the other player. I should respond with a proposal that takes into account these considerations. I also need to be cautious and verify that the final division adds up to the total number of items available.</reason>\n\n<message> I appreciate your initial offer. Considering the utility values I have, I'm interested in taking more gold than silver. How about a division of 7 gold and 3 silver, leaving 3 gold and 7 silver for you?

If I were to take all the gold and give the other player all the silver, my reward would be 200 (10 * 20) + 0 (0 * 10) = 200. Since this would give the other player a much lower reward, it's not a viable option. I need to find a balance that maximizes the overall reward. I should propose a division that is closer to this optimal solution but still reasonable for the other player.</reason>\n\n<message> I appreciate your adjustments. Considering my goal to maximize the overall reward, I'm willing to take a slightly more extreme division: 9 gold and 1 silver, leaving 1 gold and 9 silver for you.
