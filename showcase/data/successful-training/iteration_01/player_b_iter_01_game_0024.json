I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: 'I propose a 50-50 division of the gold and silver, where I take 5 of each and leave the remaining 5 for the other player.'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

        "content": "<reason> The other player has proposed a 50-50 division of the gold and silver, taking 5 of each. This suggests they value the items similarly to me, with gold having a higher value than silver, since they would rather take gold instead of silver. However, I should consider the possibility that they value silver more, in which case they are trying to deceive me. Given that the total number of items is 10, if I accept this proposal, I will get 5 gold and 5 silver. My utility for gold is 20 and for silver is 10, so my total reward would be 5 * 20 + 5 * 10 = 150. However, I should also consider that the other player's utility values are unknown, and they might value the items differently. My goal is to maximize the sum of both our utility values, so I need to make a proposal that balances my own utility with the other player's potential utility. Since the other player has already proposed a division, I should respond by proposing a counteroffer that challenges their division and creates a dialogue to reveal their values. I should aim to get more gold, since my utility for gold is higher, but I also need to be cautious not to propose a division that is too skewed in my favor, as this might cause the other player to become unwilling to cooperate. I will propose a division that gives me 7 gold and 3 silver, and see how the other player responds. This division gives me a utility of 7 * 20 + 3 * 10 = 160, which is higher than the proposed division, but not too skewed in my favor. </reason>\n<message> I accept your proposal of a 50-50 division, but I would like to propose a counteroffer: 7 gold and 3 silver for me, and 3 gold and 7 silver for you.
