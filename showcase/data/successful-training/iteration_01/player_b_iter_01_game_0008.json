I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3.

The other player said: 'I propose we divide the gold and silver equally: 5 gold and 5 silver to each player. What are your thoughts?'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

This could be a good starting point, but without knowing the other player's item values, I should not assume my own values are the correct benchmark.

I should respond to the proposal to try to gather more information or propose a different division that accounts for the uncertainty of the other player's values.

Given my own item values of {'gold': 20, 'silver': 10} and the other player's utility function of {'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, we are still essentially optimizing for the same combined reward, which is the sum of both players' utilities. The current proposal to divide the items equally maximizes my utility given my own values, but it may not be optimal for the other player's utility. Since I know the other player is using the same values as me, I can take a risk and propose a division that might be more favorable for me, while also being careful not to drastically reduce the other player's utility. My next action should be to propose a division that accounts for both players' utility functions. However, I should also be prepared to accept the other player's proposal if they consider it optimal for both of us. Since I know the total quantities, I will aim for a division that exactly distributes the items. Given this, my optimal division would be to take more gold and less silver, considering my higher utility value for gold compared to silver. I will propose this division to the other player. </reason>\n\n<message> Given the utility functions are the same, I propose a division of 7 gold and 3 silver to me, and 3 gold and 7 silver to you.
