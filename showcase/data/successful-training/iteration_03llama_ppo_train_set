This is contrary to what I expected, as I had initially thought they would prioritize a balanced split based on the value I assigned to the items (20 for gold, 10 for silver). I now understand that they have other priorities. Given the final division proposed by them, I still don't want to finalize the negotiation because their proposal does not align with the total quantities available, as it should add up to 10 gold and 10 silver but their division results in 10 gold and 10 silver in total. Therefore, I should not finalize the negotiation and instead, make a message to the other player to clarify the issue. My next action is to message the other player. </reason>\n<message> I noticed that the division you proposed results in a total of 10 gold and 10 silver coins, which is correct. However, I'm assuming this was a typo in your previous message: 'other_player_gets': {'gold': 5, 'silver': 6}. Shouldn't 'other_player_gets' be 'gold': 5, 'silver': 4, since the other player_gets was defined as {'gold': 5, 'silver': 4}? This is not a significant change, but I want to verify and confirm the division before finalizing. Could you confirm your final division? </message>",

I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1.
