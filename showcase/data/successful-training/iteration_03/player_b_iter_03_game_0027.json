I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: 'Initial proposal: I would like to take 5 gold and 7 silver, leaving the other player with 5 gold and 3 silver. Is this acceptable to you?'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

I need to maximize the total utility, which is the sum of my utility values multiplied by the items I take and the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take. Since I know my utility values, I can calculate my potential reward for the proposed division. My utility values are [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}]. The total utility for me in the proposed division would be (5*10) + (3*10) = 50 + 30 = 80. However, I need to consider the other player's potential utility in the proposed division. Since the other player's utility values are unknown, I have to make an educated guess based on the proposed division. If the other player values gold higher, they might reject this offer and try to take more gold. On the other hand, if they value silver higher, they might be satisfied with this division. Considering that there are equal quantities of gold and silver, I will assume the other player values silver higher, and try to negotiate a better deal for myself. </reason>\n\n<message> Would you be willing to consider a division where I take 6 gold and 4 silver, leaving 4 gold and 6 silver for you? </message>",

This counter-proposal increases the amount of gold I get compared to the initial proposal, but still seems to prioritize my silver.

If I prioritize the lower utility value of 10, the total utility for me in the counter-proposal would be (6*10) + (4*20) = 60 + 80 = 140. Since 160 is greater than 140, I should prioritize the higher utility value of 20 and assume that the other player values silver higher. However, the division proposed in the counter-proposal is more balanced than before and seems to bring both of our utilities closer to being maximized. Since this division seems acceptable to both of us, I should finalize the negotiation and accept this proposal. However, to make sure that we both agree, I should also make sure that the final division we agree on adds up perfectly to the provided quantities. My final division will be 4 gold and 6 silver, but I need to make sure that the other player's final division is also 6 gold and 4 silver. Since we already have a proposed division from them that matches this, I can safely finalize the negotiation. However, it is still necessary to confirm that the proposed division with the other player does indeed sum up to the items provided. My final division is also '4 gold and 4 silver' and I know this matches 4 + 6 to be '10', which is correct, but I know '10 gold and ",
