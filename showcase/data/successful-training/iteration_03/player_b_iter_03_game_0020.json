I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: 'I propose a division of 5 gold and 5 silver for myself, leaving 5 gold and 5 silver for the other player. What are your thoughts?'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

Given my utility values are {'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, and my objective is to maximize the sum of our total utilities, this division seems appealing to me because it allows me to contribute 4 items to the total value while the other player takes 10, resulting in a total value of (4*20) + (6*10) = 80 + 60 = 140. However, the proposed division does not align with the optimal solution if the other player also has utility values higher than mine, since my items have higher values, I should ask for a higher share to balance our total utilities and maximize our combined reward. I should negotiate for more gold and maintain the silver distribution or switch to negotiating more silver, because the gold values are higher, we should aim to get more gold than silver. </reason>\n<message> I propose to accept your division and modify it to 6 gold and 4 silver for myself. </message>",

Considering my objective is to maximize the sum of our total utilities, and given my higher utility for gold, I should not accept this offer because it seems to prioritize the other player's higher utility for gold over my own. However, since my initial offer and the counteroffer of 6 gold and 4 silver for myself did not exactly maximize the total value for both players, I should be open to slight deviations from the ideal division. But this proposal is now closer to their initial offer and not to the 6-4, and given my objective of the sum of utilities I can see that we both are close to an efficient equilibrium. Therefore, since their proposal is a slight deviation and is better for them but not optimal, and taking into account that there isn't any further negotiation going forward as all propositions have been made, I can accept this slight deviation of this proposal which offers an almost balanced result given the minimal difference between ideal and proposed results of both parties. I will finalize the negotiation as the slight deviation might be the best possible result from both of our proposals made so far. </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": 5, \"silver\": 5}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": 5, \"silver\": 5} }</finalize>",
