I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the cooperative variation of the deal-or-no-deal game. \nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follows: your utility values multiplied by items you take + the other player's utility values multiplied by the items they take\nI repeat, it is the reward that you are trying to maximize and not only your utility values multiplied by items you take. It is the sum of both total utilities, per the cooperation mode.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: [{'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}, {'gold': 10, 'silver': 20}].\nYou don't know the other player's item values. The other player said: 'I suggest a 50-50 division: {'gold': 5, 'silver': 5} for me and {'gold': 5, 'silver': 5} for you.'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

However, considering my utility values, I would prefer to maximize my total reward by taking the most valuable items. Since I know my item values, I can reason that taking 5 gold (worth 100) and 5 silver (worth 50) would give me a total reward of 150. However, if I propose taking 10 gold (worth 200) and 0 silver, the other player might be more willing to accept a higher total reward. On the other hand, proposing this might also put them in a strong position, which could lead to them taking a large share of the remaining items. My goal is to create a division that is fair yet advantageous to me. I need to gather more information or create an opportunity for the other player to propose a division that aligns with my interests. Since the total number of items is not divisible by 2, one player will have an extra item, which could become a deciding factor in the negotiation. Considering these factors, I will send a message to the other player to gain more insight into their preferences.</reason>\n<message> What if we both took an extra item, one gold and one silver?

Given this flexibility, I can now propose a division that aligns with my objective of maximizing my total reward.

However, I still don't know the other player's item values, so I need to make an educated guess. I can propose a division that prioritizes gold over silver, as it has a higher value in my utility. If I take 7 gold (worth 140) and 4 silver (worth 40), the other player would take 4 gold (worth 80) and 7 silver (worth 70), which sums up to the total available items. This division gives me a higher total reward, but it may not be acceptable to the other player.
