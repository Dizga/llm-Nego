My objective is to maximize my reward by proposing a division of the items between myself and the other player. I have utility values for each item, but the other player's utility values are unknown. My strategy will be to start with a reasonable proposal that balances the division of gold and silver items. To fulfill my objective, I should consider proposing an initial division where we each get half of the items. However, I must also be prepared for the possibility that the other player may propose a different division, requiring me to respond accordingly. Since the total utility values for gold and silver are 30 and 10, respectively, an even split seems a reasonable starting point. I will choose to message the other player. </reason>\n\n<message> I suggest we start with an even division: 5 gold and 5 silver for each of us. Let's see if you agree with this proposal. </message>",

Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1.
