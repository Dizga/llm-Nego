I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\n\n            You are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\n            The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n            \n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3.

The other player said: ' Hi! How would you feel about me taking the hat and book, and you taking the 4 balls? This way, we both get something we want. What do you think?

While the balls are worth 1 point each to me (totaling 4 points), the book is worth significantly more (6 points). By accepting their proposal, I maximize my utility from the balls but lose out on the higher utility from the book. It's important to consider that the other player might be valuing the hat or book more highly, which is why they are proposing this division. A counter-proposal to balance the utilities for both of us might be more advantageous. An optimal offer would be one in which I could secure the book due to its high value for me, and ideally, a balance of the remaining items.\n\nNext, I will counter-propose that I take the book and 1 ball (total utility: 7), and they take the hat and the remaining 3 balls, which hopefully aligns fairly to their utility values. This ensures I get the high utility from the book, and they still get a good portion of the remaining items.\n\nCurrent items:\n- Books: 1\n- Hats: 1\n- Balls: 4 </reason>\n\n<message> How about this: I take the book and 1 ball, and you take the hat and the remaining 3 balls.
