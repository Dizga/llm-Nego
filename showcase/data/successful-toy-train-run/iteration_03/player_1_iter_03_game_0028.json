I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2.

The other player said: 'I propose an equal division: 1 book, 0.5 hats, 2 balls for me, and 0.5 books, 0.5 hats, 2 balls for you.'\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'books': 1, 'hats': 1, 'balls': 4}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

Given my utility values (books: 0, hats: 2, balls: 2), I can calculate my utility for the proposed division as follows: 0 * 0.5 (books) + 2 * 0.5 (hats) + 2 * 2 (balls) = 3.5. This is a relatively high utility, but I'm not sure if it's the maximum possible utility I can achieve. I need to consider whether I can propose a better division or if the other player will accept this division. However, since the other player has proposed an equal division, it's likely that they are trying to maximize their own utility as well. Therefore, I need to carefully consider my next move to ensure I don't leave too much on the table. I will send a message to the other player to propose an alternative division that may better align with my objective.</reason>\n\n<message> I appreciate your proposal for an equal division. However, considering my utility values, I was thinking of a division where I take 0 books, 1 hat, and 2 balls, and you take 1 book and 0.5 hats and 2 balls.
