I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player, who is your partner. Your objective is to maximize your reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. No items should be left over. Your partner has the same objective. Your utility values and your partner's utility values are different.\n\nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and your partner will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After a few exchanges, when you feel ready, you can make a finalization to the game coordinator. Once a player decides to make a finalization, their partner must also make a finalization, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging your partner or sending a finalization).\nfinalization: A finalization should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for your partner. The finalization should be JSON parsable.\nMatching finalizations: If the combined finalizations don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nfinalizations: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'gold': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'gold': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is your partner share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to your partner here.] </message>\n\n2. [Partner responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to your partner here.] </message>\n\n3.
