If you're sure we should consider making compromises to the benefit of your reward, I can suggest adjusting your division to gain a higher amount of gold, say 8 gold and 6 silver for you. With that adjustment, our counts then become (8 gold, 6 silver) for you vs. (2 gold, 4 silver) for me. This slightly benefits you but leaves us with room to optimize using adjustments of available sums as available. </message>"

Given your value of 20 for gold and 10 for silver, it seems that you prefer gold over silver. With my values being 10 for gold and 20 for silver, I think I have a stronger preference for silver. I would like to propose an alternative: why don't we switch our agreed-upon shares so that I take 5 silver and you take 4 silver? This would give us both a fair shot at getting closer to our respective preferences.</message>"

However, I'm not sure I want to switch to taking 4 silver and letting you take 5 silver. Remember, my value for silver is lower than gold, and I'm likely to hurt my overall reward with this swap. I'd like to go back to my original idea of you taking 4 silver and me taking the remaining gold, but let's make it work for gold: if you take 4 silver, I will take the other 6 gold. This would be a total of 60 for me (4 * 20 = 80, but I'm really only taking 6 gold, so 20 + 80 silver: doesn't make much sense, I am  only taking 6 gold of the remaining 6 silver will not be discussed)  <correction (6 gold) -> and 40 for you, with a substantial margin.'\nPerform the next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}."

If you take 6 gold and I take 4 silver, that's a total of 6 + 4, which is 10 out of 10 gold. However, the total number of silver in the initial distribution is also 10, and you only allocated 4 silver to my end. This means I would be left with 6 silver. Can you confirm if you're aware of this discrepancy? If so, would you be willing to reconsider your proposal and allocate more silver to me?</message>"
