By responding in kind, I'll reinforce our current understanding. In light of this change, I now acknowledge my own values align more with our negotiations, which implies I shouldn't try hard to nudge for a stronger preference towards gold from you. However, since the tempered offer of 6 gold and 7 silver confirms the advantage of gold, it would be optimal to compensate for the loss in silver by having the other player value myself as easily trading away silver. It remains crucial they won't test me in a future proposition of higher silver if I requested that ahead. With this clears as much as understanding is possible, I'd like to cautiously maintain my trade offers this round but anticipate future optimization in further rounds.'\nPerform the next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}."

Considering your value maximizing perspective, might it be feasible to re-evaluate the previous offer and step towards the 50-50 ratio for gold while attempting to claim more in terms of a high value item (in this case, silver), while also ensuring your reward stays within an optimal position?

The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1.
