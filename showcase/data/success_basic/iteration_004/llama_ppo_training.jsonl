On the other hand, our previous exchange showed that you could be persuaded to a 7-3 division. Considering my utility for silver is lower, a 10-0 division does appeal to me. However, I want to see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.

Given that my utility values for gold are 10 points and for silver are 20 points, I can see that exchanging more of my utility for less silver doesn't serve me well. What if instead, I considered a split where I accept a smaller number of golds and pair it with some of the total silver we have. For example, if instead I got 8 gold and 2 silver, my utility would be 80 + 40 = 120, which is a good alternative.

This means we each take 5 out of 10 gold and, in total balance, 10 silvers. However, I shouldn't have proposed a split directly on the silvers. Instead, I should have proposed that we split the gold and we each take a certain number of silvers to balance our portion.
