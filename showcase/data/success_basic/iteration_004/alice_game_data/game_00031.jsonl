I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3.

The other player said: 'I'd like to propose a division of 50% gold to both us and 50% silver to both us. However, since there are more golds, I can suggest going halfway with the gold, so that we each take 5 golds and the remaining 5 go to the other player. As for the silvers, we each take 5 to meet the total 50%. If this sounds good, I'll propose to finalize the negotiation.'\nPerform the next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.",

I did not intend to suggest we discard 5 silvers. My intention was that the 50/50 split is between the gold and the total of both gold and silver, which is 20. This means we each take 5 out of 10 gold and, in total balance, 10 silvers. However, I shouldn't have proposed a split directly on the silvers. Instead, I should have proposed that we split the gold and we each take a certain number of silvers to balance our portion. Going back to that idea, I think it would be fair to propose we each take 9 golds and 1 silver, as 9 golds + 1 silver = 10, which would be a balance that each player takes half of the total value, giving 9*20=180 in value to myself and 9*20+10=190 in value for the other player, but let me keep it simpler since I have no information on your item values. Considering going back to splitting 50/50 and accepting the imbalance, we could try splitting the gold and getting the other player silvers to make both of our portions perfectly balanced in the total values. If you accept this plan then let's simply say 5 golds and 5 silvers for each since their silver value is unknown and does not affect my decision. Or alternatively, we do what originally was proposed but more so very simply. When I finalize, I will consider your item values but first I have to run either our proposed original deal or your accepting of 5 gold/5 silver'\nPerform the next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.",
