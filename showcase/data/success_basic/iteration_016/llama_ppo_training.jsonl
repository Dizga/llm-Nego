Taking your 5-5 split as an example, that would leave 5 gold and 5 silver remaining for you. My total value for gold would be 10 * 5 = 50, and my total value for silver would be 20 * 5 = 100. I value silver quadruple gold, but I am not getting enough trade value from the current division since 100 / 50 = 2, less than 4 (the ratio of my item values). Thus, a more agreeable 5-5 split doesn't guarantee me a larger trade value, I should consider it more carefully. How about we compromise at 4 gold and 6 silver?</message>"
