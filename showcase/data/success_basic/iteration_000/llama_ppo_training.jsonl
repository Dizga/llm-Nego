If we keep the same split of 10 silver, that accounts for 10 silver coordinated evenly to both players. I'd propose that we distribute gold in a proportion based on our respective gold preferences (I value gold at 20 points, while you, apparently, don't value it more than silver). With a combined total of 20 points per gold (10 gold * 2 * 20 points per gold), and considering 10 of the points allocated in silver, this leaves 2 points for each 1 gold unit of distribution. So, if we divide the 20 points into two shared portions, for relatively equal value gold amount allocations, I suggest 3 gold (6 points for 6 gold value times 1) plus 7 gold (14 points for 7 gold value times 2). My apologies if this miscalculates your overall negotiation tactics however, in this specific round: i aim to get closer in total points number. Silver amounts total to 10 which I've shown, with one gold amount terms adjusted on them so 10 silver+ 3 gold or 10 silver+ 7 gold mining 10 +1 .  'gold': 3 + 7 - yes I see your offer.</message>."
