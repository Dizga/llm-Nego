I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3.

If we keep the same split of 10 silver, that accounts for 10 silver coordinated evenly to both players. I'd propose that we distribute gold in a proportion based on our respective gold preferences (I value gold at 20 points, while you, apparently, don't value it more than silver). With a combined total of 20 points per gold (10 gold * 2 * 20 points per gold), and considering 10 of the points allocated in silver, this leaves 2 points for each 1 gold unit of distribution. So, if we divide the 20 points into two shared portions, for relatively equal value gold amount allocations, I suggest 3 gold (6 points for 6 gold value times 1) plus 7 gold (14 points for 7 gold value times 2). My apologies if this miscalculates your overall negotiation tactics however, in this specific round: i aim to get closer in total points number. Silver amounts total to 10 which I've shown, with one gold amount terms adjusted on them so 10 silver+ 3 gold or 10 silver+ 7 gold mining 10 +1 .  'gold': 3 + 7 - yes I see your offer.</message>.",

Nevertheless, considering your aim to get closer in total points number, I'd like to slightly adjust the distribution while keeping the silver amounts the same and the overall points proximity to my preference in mind. Could you consider redistributing the gold so the distribution will align closer to my original preference, perhaps considering 2 and 8, which still stays in the range you calculated.
