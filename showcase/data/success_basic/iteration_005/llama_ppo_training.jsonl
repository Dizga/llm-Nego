However, that insight alone isn't enough to change my valuation. I'm open to reassessing my valuation based on the progression of this negotiation. Considering your new offer of 8 gold and 2 silver, this actually fits very closely to the equal-value idea I initially proposed (7 gold and 3 silver). However, with your revised proposal, you still maintain a slightly higher total benefit through the silver parcels. Despite this, I'm willing to make one final adjustment if you're open to further compromise.

If you get 10 gold and I get 10 silver, it would mean that you're getting an item of 20 value for every item I'm getting of 20 value. To balance this, I propose we compare the value of each gold and silver. Since I value silver 2 times as much as gold, I think we should get equal value worth. That's two silvers for every gold.
