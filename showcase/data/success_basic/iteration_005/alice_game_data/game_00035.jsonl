I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3.

The other player said: 'I propose to take 3 gold and 6 silver coins, with the remaining 7 gold and 4 silver coins going to the other player. Please respond with your interest in accepting this proposal or making a counteroffer.'\nPerform the next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.",

        "content": "<message> To determine the minimum cutoff, let's consider the total value for us and each other's resources as buckets. For us, the total combined value is 300 points. We would need to divide it down the middle such that neither side has less than 100/300 times 300 points. From my perspective, the resources 'gold' and 'silver' carry different proportions of the resource value, i.e., 1/10 is worth 10 points, while 1/10 is worth 20 points. So my gold is worth 1/2 as much as silver, the proportion is: (gold/silver) = 1/2. For both resources distributed, the value with 'x'-gold taken would add together (x*10) + (10-x)*20 = (10*10) POINTS. I find that x = 3.33 checks off and actually my 'x contracted gold' = (10 * 10 / (10 + 20)), which indeed gives 3.33. Since we can't take only 0.33, rounding up would mean the 'maximum cutoff point'  at which the distribution will not compensate me would be at 1 '(gold)' which is lower than 3. I want to send you a Concentric distribution going out: ['Say you wanted to receive 7 gold, while the 13 silver would remain intact' we can keep neither below 100/300 ratio point distribution for both player's maximal compensation], as silver has a greater value and gold per item, since both have more significant points and silver(points: 20) > gold(points: 10).
