My insistence on 6 out of 10 for silver was more due to its high value to me, making smaller shares less appealing. However, I'm willing to compromise if a clearly more efficient division emerges. If I take 7 silver, for example, that's not drastically smaller and still values silver significantly more than gold, but doesn't rigidly fix the proportion. With that, let's consider the less predictable division you suggested: a division where we aim for a short sharing of low utility items with long sharing, say, respectively, 3, 1 and 8, 9. I can be satisfied with this if it leads to mutual benefit, as it seems less predictable and aligned with my utilities.</message>"
