Given the proposed division of 6 gold and 4 silver for me, it seems I would be receiving 3 silver coins for every 6 gold coins under the 2:1 rate. If I apply this rate to the total number of gold coins (which is 10), I would expect to receive 8 silver coins for a 10 gold coin trade, rather than just 4. Please think about this compromise and consider if this seems reasonable to you. If so, a final division can then be proposed. </message>"
