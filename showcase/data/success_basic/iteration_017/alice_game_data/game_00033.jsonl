I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3.

The other player said: 'I propose a division of 8 gold and 2 silver for myself, and the remaining items go to the other player. This aligns with the maximum value I can get in case the other player doesn't value silver highly, with a reward of 160. If the other player values silver highly, they might accept my proposal or try to counteroffer.'\nPerform the next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}.",

The initial 8 gold left your share equal to roughly 160. Dividing this by the 8 items left, the ratio of the value my assumption of, gold per, item is trusted now results in for 2, if 8, gold originally being with a 160 value 1, value could equal, it follows that The silver value for the given remaining amenities must be less than gold as gold yields higher returns than silver for our split and proposing 2 gold, since 2, we compose that difference to prove our marshaled high expectation, yes you should take 2 by my terms only, as we unsure - gold far is far by overall view trusting you built.(8 gold in initial deal reported as exchange value certain you self as witnessed ver ansphere those is guaranteed nd gold know shadow poc as div 160/gold).
