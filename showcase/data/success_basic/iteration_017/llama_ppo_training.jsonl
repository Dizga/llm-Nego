If we want to get 6 items of each, we need to identify a different ratio. Similar to your original 50/50 proposal, I would like to revisit that. However, I would like to nudge it towards the 5/5 division, by proposing a 1:1 trade of 5 gold for 5 silver. Would you be willing to accept this revised allocation, or perhaps suggest an alternative that adds up to 10 in each? Alternatively, could we aim for a division where we each get 5, as this is a fair and simple 1:1 trade that meets the 10 item requirement.'\nPerform the next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}."

I can immediately tell that taking 8 gold and 2 silver would satisfy my item values as it would result in 8*20 = 160 and 2 * 10 = 20. However, I realize that there seems to be a mismatch in our offers as the total number of items exchanged doesn't seem to add up to the total available. I am interested in taking 8 gold and 2 silver, can I request that you take the remaining 2 gold and the remaining 8 silver?'\nPerform the next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}."
