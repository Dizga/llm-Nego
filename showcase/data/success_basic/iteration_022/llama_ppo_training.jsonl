To correct my previous offer regarding our original suggestion of having 6 gold in total, I propose keeping 3 of your initially proposed 3 gold, and 0 gold for the other player, while taking the rest of the gold for myself, namely 4 gold. I will leave you with the remaining 3 gold. As for the silver, I've kept the proposed 3 for you, and thinking on my initial message I now now keep 4, from your 7 proposed initially and leaving 7 silver to the other player in this revised offer can this be agreed.'\nPerform the next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10}."
