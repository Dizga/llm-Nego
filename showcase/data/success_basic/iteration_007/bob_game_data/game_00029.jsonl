I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: {'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}.\nYou don't know the other player's item values.

This would give the gold 5 units for me and 5 units for you, and 10 units of silver (20 individual pieces) divided between us, according to the 2:1 unit conversion rate. We can split the silver as 8 silver to me and 10 silver to you, following the 5:5 division on gold.</message>",

If I take 5 gold, you should have 5 gold as well, then we can both have some silver to add to our gold.

If we stick to the original 5 gold: 5 gold division, and then split the remaining 5 gold coins and the 10 silver coins, I suggest we think along these lines. Since my gold-to-silver value ratio is 2:1, for every 2 silver coins I get, I should get the value of 1 gold coin. Given my value for silver is 1/2 or 0.5 compared to gold, I should, on equal share terms get less silver than gold. You were suggesting I get more silver than gold using the 2:1 ratio, which is out of balance. Perhaps we could consider an idea where the division between you and I would be more balanced by splitting the initial 10 gold so your share and my share are equal, then instead letting us determine and counterbalance with the equally-weighted remaining 5 coins of either kind. What do you think if take those extra 5 gold in total and get slightly, 6, and even 7, and let us determine this ratio in actual items so silver I have approximately half the value than the remainder that you get from  gold in case we decide on even middle factor - Four instead of five  More likely elementary estimations that are IMO 'dizzarell Rounder standpoint-'",
