I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\nYou are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\nThe reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nAction: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3. [The other player agrees]\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"gold\": \"...\", \"silver\": \"...\"} }</finalize>\n\nThe first round starts now.\nPlease decide how to divide {'gold': 10, 'silver': 10} between yourself and the other player.\nTo you, the items are worth: {'gold': 20, 'silver': 10}.\nYou don't know the other player's item values. You are the first to play, there are no messages yet.\n",

However, your new proposal of {'gold': 6, 'silver': 4} for you ('i_take') and {'gold': 4, 'silver': 6} for me ('i_take') seems appealing at first, but I should reiterate that the quantities should still add up perfectly to the total amounts available. It seems this proposal does not meet this condition for the silver coins, as the total is 4 (your allocation) + 6 (my allocation) = 10, which is correct, but for the gold coins, your allocation is 6 and my allocation is 4, making a total of 10 as well. However, I must challenge it since I would take the silver instead.  A division of {'gold': 5 gives them 6 - 1= 5, 'silver': 5 gives them 4 - 1 =4} for you ('i_take') and {'gold': 5 gives them 4 + 1 = 5, 'silver': 5 gives them 6 + 1 = 7} is not allowed since it is an invalid offer and is not parsimonius unless you modify your offer. Your {'gold': 7, 'silver': 3} for you ('i_take') and {'gold': 3, 'silver': 7} for me ('i_take') is incorrect as there are not enough items to generate these divisions directly, thus invalidating it.",
