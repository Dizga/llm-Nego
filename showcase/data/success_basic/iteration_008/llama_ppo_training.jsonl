In that division, I would receive 40 points for the gold from the 4 gold you are offering, because 4 * 5 * 2 = 40 and also because 6 * 5 = 30 so 40+30 = 70 * 5/7, minus 7/5 * 16 = 44, then seven tenths of the 5 = 3.5 then  40 - 3.5 = 36.5 then 40 - 36.5 = 3.5 for the 6. Taking 0 gold under my utility values makes 0 *2  * 10 = 0. And compared to that opting for 5 silver under your utility values yields 5*2 * 5 = 50 then 5/7 * 20 = 14.3 then five tenths of 20 = 10 then 50 - 14.3 - 10 = 25.7 then the values for the now remaining three for you are 3* 2 * 10 with  3 * 20   then  60 + 60 = 120 then 120 /7 = 17.1 20 * 13/20 = 13 and 17.1 - 13 is 4.1, so that's 52 - 4.1 = 47.9 24 /7 = 3.428571 so  47.9 -  10 - 10 * (3.428571) = 27.179  I should have 10  points from the 6 you're keeping and 36.5  from the four you're giving  which is higher than the 27.179  . I would rather have all the gold and exchange it for some silver to achieve a better point maximization. My best interest calls for prioritizing gold. In light of this, here's a counter-proposal. </message>"
