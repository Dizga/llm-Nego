After a few exchanges, when you feel ready, you can make a final proposal to the game coordinator. Once a player decides to make a final proposal, their partner must also make a final proposal, ending the game.\\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging your partner or sending a final proposal).\\nFinal Proposal: A final proposal should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for your partner.
