I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\n\n            You are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\n            The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n            \n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1.

Given that I value books at 0, hats at 2, and balls at 1, my priority is to maximize utility by securing the hats, as they provide more points. Since there are many hats available, I might suggest a division that allows me to take a significant share of the hats, as the book is not valuable to me. A good starting proposal would be for me to take 1 book, 3 hats, and 1 ball, while the other player takes the remaining hat and 1 ball. This ensures we cover all items, and I secure a high utility from the hats. I will send this initial proposal to the other player now. </reason>\n<message> I propose the following division: I take 1 book, 3 hats, and 1 ball, while you take 1 hat and 1 ball. This way, we both get a share of the items, and I can secure the hats, which are valuable to me. What do you think? </message>",

This division gives them a utility of (0*1) + (1*2) + (2*1) = 4 points (from the book and balls), while I would receive a utility of (4*2) = 8 points from the hats. This proposition heavily favors me, as I secure all the hats, which are quite valuable from my perspective. However, I should also consider the possibility that they might value the book and balls more than what they expressed. Given that I still want to make an effort to negotiate cooperatively, I might propose a slightly different division where I take 3 hats and both balls while they take 1 book and 1 hat. This would still maximize my utility while giving the other player something of value as well. I'll present this idea in my next message. </reason>\n<message> Thank you for your proposal! It seems we can find a compromise. How about I take 3 hats and both balls, while you take 1 book and 1 hat? This way, I still get a good portion while you ensure you have the valuable book.

This division gives them a utility score of (0*1) + (3*2) = 6 points from the hats, and I would receive a utility of (1*1) = 1 point from the ball. While this proposal provides them with a decent score, it leaves me with very little utility, which is not ideal since I value the hats quite highly. I want to ensure I get a fair share based on the available items. I believe a better solution would be for both of us to take an equitable share. I can suggest that I take 1 book, 2 hats, and 1 ball while the other player takes 2 hats. This adjustment allows me to secure a book and ensure I get some value. I will communicate this alternative in my next message. </reason>\n<message> I appreciate your proposal!

This division is more balanced than previous offers, but I still find it slightly unbalanced since I value hats more and want to secure some value in my share. However, given the context of our negotiations, this may be an acceptable compromise. Since my total utility here is not less than what I would get, I might want to consider finalizing this division, as it covers all items without surplus. Still, I can double-check with the other player if they might consider adjusting their share slightly, perhaps by proposing a balanced decision where I take 1 hat instead of 2. I'll attempt to finalize the negotiation if there's no further room for understanding. </reason>\n<message> Your proposal is quite reasonable, and I appreciate the effort!
