I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\n\n            You are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\n            The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n            \n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1.

This division correctly allocates all available items, using {'books': 1, 'hats': 3, 'balls': 1} without leaving any behind. However, from my perspective, this division is not favorable. I value the book at 6 points and the ball at 4 points, while hats are worth 0 points to me. \n\nBy accepting their proposal, I would score 0 points while the other player would score 10 points (6 points for the book and 4 points for the ball). This would not be an effective outcome for me, as I have a strong interest in securing the book for its high value.\n\nRather than agreeing to this proposal, I should counter with a suggestion that allows me to keep the book, which is crucial to maximizing my score. I can offer a compromise that still gives something valuable to the other player. I will propose again to take the book and one hat, and the other player can take the ball and the remaining two hats. This way, I secure the book while ensuring no items are left unallocated. </reason>\n<message> I appreciate your offer, but I believe I would need to ensure that I secure the book as it holds the highest value for me.
