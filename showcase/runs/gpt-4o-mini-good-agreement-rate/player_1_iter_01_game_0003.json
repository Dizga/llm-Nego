I, the user, will be the game coordinator, acting as a middleman between you and the other player. Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\n\n            You are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\n            The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n            \n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1.

Evaluating this proposal, I can calculate the total utility for both parties:\n\n- If I take 2 hats (1 utility each) and 1 ball (5 utility), my total utility would be 2 + 5 = 7 utility points.\n- The other player would then get 1 book (2 utility) and 1 hat (1 utility), totaling their utility at 3 utility points.\n\nWhile this division uses up all items and provides me a decent score, I must consider if it's favorable. Since I value the book at 2 utility points and could potentially gain more utility by securing that book for myself, I should propose a counter-offer where I take the book and possibly the ball while leaving the remaining hats for the other player.\n\nSince my objective is to maximize my utility, I will suggest a variation where I propose taking the 1 book and the 1 ball, while the other player can take 3 hats. This might lead to a more advantageous outcome for me. I will then message this proposal to the other player. </reason>\n<message> I appreciate your proposal! However, I believe we could find a better balance. How about I take the 1 book and the 1 ball, while you take the 3 hats? This way, we use all items, and I can maximize my utility a bit better.

However, since their agreement also leaves me with a reasonable score, it might not be prudent to push for further negotiations in terms of securing the book myself.\n\nGiven the current situation, I will choose to finalize the negotiation based on their proposal, which is fair because it balances both players' utilities. </reason>\n<finalize>{ \"i_take\": {\"books\": 0, \"hats\": 2, \"balls\": 1}, \"other_player_gets\": {\"books\": 1, \"hats\": 1, \"balls\": 0} }</finalize>",
