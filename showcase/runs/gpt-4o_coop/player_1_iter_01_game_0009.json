Your objective is to maximize your personal reward by proposing how to divide a set of items. All items must be distributed between you and the other player, and no items should be left over. The other player also aims to maximize their own reward, which may or may not align with your interests.\n\n\n            You are playing the vanilla variation of this game.\n            The reward you are trying to maximize is calculated as follow: your utility values multiplied by items you take.\n            \n\nGame Mechanics:\nTurn-taking: You and the other player will take turns exchanging one message at a time. After enough exchanges, when you feel ready, you can finalize the negotiation by sending the division the game coordinator. Once a player decides to send a final division, the other player must also send a final division, ending the game.\nReasoning and Action: At the start of your turn, you will be asked to reason about the current state of the game and how to fulfill your objective, then make an action (either messaging the other player or finalize the negotiation).\nFinal Division: The final division should specify how many of each item you want, leaving the remaining items for the other player. It should be JSON parsable. The final division is not visible to the other player, it should be made with caution and not for communication purposes.\nMatching Divisions: If the combined division don't match the total number of items available, both players score 0.\n\nFormatting:\nReasoning: <reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\nMessages: <message> [Your message here.] </message>\nFinal division: <finalize>{ \"i_take\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'}, \"other_player_gets\": {'books': '...', 'hats': '...', 'balls': '...'} }</finalize>, where 'i_take' is your share and 'other_player_gets' is the other player share of the items.\n\nOnly do one reasoning + action per turn.\n\nExemples of how turns might proceed:\n1. [Initial state is given]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n2. [The other player responds]\n<reason> [Your reasoning here.] </reason>\n<message> [Your message to the other player here.] </message>\n\n3.

The other player said: ' I propose that I take 3 balls and 1 book, and you get 1 ball, 1 hat, and 1 book. What do you think about that? '\nAs a reminder, there is a total of {'books': 2, 'hats': 1, 'balls': 4}.\nUsing the <reason> tag, reason about the exchanges so far, how to fulfill your objective, and what should be your next action: message the other player or finalize the negotiation.\nDo not forget that both players will receive 0 points if the finalizations do not add up perfectly to the provided quantities. \nThen do it using the appropriate tag: <message> or <finalize>.",

The other player suggests the following division:\n- Other player: 3 balls, 1 book\n- Myself: 1 ball, 1 hat, 1 book\n\nFor my utility:\n- Books: 3 (worth 3 points each)\n- Hats: 1 (worth 4 points each)\n- Balls: 1 (worth 0 points each)\n\nSo, the utility of their offer for me would be:\n- 1 Book: 3 points\n- 1 Hat: 4 points\n- 1 Ball: 0 points\n\nTotal utility: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 points.\n\nSince balls hold no utility for me, I don\u2019t value the 1 ball being proposed for my share. I would prefer a division that maximizes my utility by prioritizing books and hats. Additionally, from the offer, it appears the other player might value balls significantly as they want 3 of them.\n\nTo reach a more favorable compromise for myself:\n1. I prefer having both books and the sole hat because they contribute to my higher utility.\n2. I can give the other player all the balls since they have no utility for me, but they seem valuable to the other player.\n\nTherefore, my counterproposal would be:\n- Other player: 4 balls\n- Myself: 2 books, 1 hat\n\nI will message this counterproposal to the other player and see if they agree to this division.\n</reason>\n\n<message>\nHow about this division: I take both books and the hat (2 books, 1 hat), and you take all the balls (4 balls)?
